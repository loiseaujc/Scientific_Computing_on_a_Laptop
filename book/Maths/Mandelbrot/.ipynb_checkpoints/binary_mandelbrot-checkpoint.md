# Simple black and white visualization

Before getting into advanced visualizations such as [Buddhabrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot), let's start simple.
Our goal for the moment will be to produce a black and white image of the Mandelbrot set.
Points belonging to the set will be shown in black and those outside in white.
The code below shows the algorithm students are most likely to come up with.

**<center>Algorithm 1: Nested `for` loops</center>**

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
def mandelbrot(c, maxiter=1000):
    # --> Boolean mask of the Mandelbrot set.
    #     Assume by default that all points are in the set.
    M = np.ones_like(c, dtype=bool)
    
    # --> Loop through the points in complex plane.
    m, n = c.shape
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            
            # --> Initial condition.
            z = 0
            
            # --> Loop until | z | > 2.
            for k in range(maxiter):
                z = z**2 + c[i, j]
                
                # --> Check exit condition.
                if np.abs(z) > 2:
                    M[i, j] = False # c[i, j] not in the set.
                    break
    return M
```

The code is pretty simple.
It takes as input all the points used to discretize the complex plane (as a 2D array).
For each of them, it iterates the quadratic function for `maxiter` iterations.
If during this process $\vert z_k \vert > 2$, $c_{ij}$ does not belong to the Mandelbrot set.
If the iteration runs until `k = maxiter`, we'll assume for all intents and purposes that $c_{ij}$ is in the set (although it may not in reality but that may require a far larger number of iterations).

Let's now benchmark this first implementation.
We'll assume $c \in \left[-2.25, 0.75\right] \times \left[ -1.25i, 1.25i\right]$ and consider a relatively coarse discretization to begin with.
The real axis is discretized with 300 points the while imaginary one is discretized with 251 points.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

# --> Mesh the complex plane.
cr, ci = np.linspace(-2.25, 0.75, 300), np.linspace(-1.25, 1.25, 251)
c = cr[:, None] + 1j*ci[None, :] # Broadcasting trick.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%timeit
mandelbrot(c, maxiter=1000)
```

On my laptop, this computation takes a bit more than half a minute.
A high-resolution image of the Mandelbrot set typically uses ten times as many points in both directions compared to our low-resolution discretization.
This would incur approximately a 100 fold increase in computational time (i.e. more than one hour).
While this might be acceptable for a one-shot image, deep diving into the Mandelbrot set with thousands of images to generate is out of reach.

## Excluding points from the main cardioid

In **Algorithm 1**, we iterate the quadratic function for all the points discretizing the complex plane.
Yet, as shown in the previous section, we know analytically that some points actually belong to the Mandelbrot set.
For any given $c$, the quadratic function admits the following fixed points

$$
z_* = \dfrac{1 \pm \sqrt{1-4c}}{2}.
$$

If $\vert z_* \vert < \dfrac{1}{2}$, these fixed points are stable and $c$ belongs to the Mandelbrot set.
This gives a simple test to check ahead of time whether the current value $c$ is or is not in the set.
We can easily modify our code to include such a test and save some precious seconds.
This is shown below.

**<center>Algorithm 2: Nested `for` loops + test for the main cardiod</center>**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def mandelbrot(c, maxiter=1000):
    # --> Boolean mask of the Mandelbrot set.
    #     Assume by default that all points are in the set.
    M = np.ones_like(c, dtype=bool)
    
    # --> Loop through the points in complex plane.
    m, n = c.shape
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            
            zs = 1 - np.sqrt(1 - 4*c[i, j])
            # --> Check if point is the main cardiod.
            if np.abs(zs) <= 1 or np.abs(zs.conj()) <= 1:
                continue
            
            # --> Initial condition.
            z = 0
            
            # --> Loop until | z | > 2.
            for k in range(maxiter):
                z = z**2 + c[i, j]
                
                # --> Check exit condition.
                if np.abs(z) > 2:
                    M[i, j] = False # c[i, j] not in the set.
                    break
    return M
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%timeit
mandelbrot(c, maxiter=1000)
```

The same computation now takes less than 10 seconds, a 4x speed-up compared to when we didn't check if $c$ belongs to the main cardioid.
If $c$ is not in the main cardioid, similar tests could be implemented to test if it instead belongs to some **period bulbs**.
This could also save us a few additional seconds to render the image.

## Vectorizing the code

Although we've achieved quite a significant speed-up, one major issue with our previous code is that it'll work only if the input `c` is a `np.array`.
Hence, we cannot use it to check if a particular value of $c$ is in the Mandelbrot set or not.
In `numpy`, a function that works both for a scalar or an array as input is known as a [universal function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/ufuncs.html), or **ufunc** in short.
`np.exp`, `np.cos` and others are all ufuncs.
A universal function is a function that operates on `np.array` in an element-by-element fashion.
It also supports broadcasting, type casting and several other standard `numpy` features.
To some extent, a ufunc can be understood as a "vectorized" wrapper for a function that takes a fixed number of specific inputs and produces a fixed number of specific outputs.

NumPy provides a simple utility, `np.vectorize`, to create user-defined ufuncs.
In what follows, we'll thus implement a function `mandelbrot` taking as input a single value of $c$ and returning whether it belongs to the Mandelbrot set or not.
We'll then make it work for array input using the decorator `@np.vectorize`.

**<center>Algorithm 3: Cleaner code with `@np.vectorize`</center>**

```{code-cell} ipython3
@np.vectorize
def mandelbrot(c, maxiter=1000):
    
    zs = 1 - np.sqrt(1 - 4*c)
    if np.abs(zs) <= 1 or np.abs(zs.conj()) <= 1:
        return True

    z = 0
    for i in range(maxiter):
        z = z**2 + c
        if np.abs(z) > 2:
            return False
    return True
```

As you can see, this new piece of code is now much cleaner than our previous implementation.
Note that we did not really get rid of the first two nested `for` loops.
They are somehow hidden in the magic numpy is doing to transform our function.
Yet, it is now more general as it'll accept both scalar values and arrays as input.
Let's benchmark it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%timeit
mandelbrot(c, maxiter=1000)
```

The code now takes approximately 6 seconds to execute, another 1.5x speed-up!
Despite what the name `np.vectorize` suggests, our function is not truly vectorized.
It still operates on an element-wise fashion rather than on the whole array at once.
The small speed-up essentially comes from tricks used by the NumPy developers.
In comparison, the code below shows what a truly vectorized implementation looks like.
Its drawback though is that it can only operate on arrays and not scalar values.

**<center>Algorithm 4: True vectorization in `numpy`</center>**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def mandelbrot(c, maxiter=1000):
    # --> Boolean mask of the Mandelbrot set.
    #     Assume of all points are in the set by default.
    M = np.ones_like(c, dtype=bool)
    
    # --> Vectorized initial condition.
    z = np.zeros_like(c, dtype=complex)
    
    for i in range(maxiter):
        # --> Iterate.
        z[M] = z[M]**2 + c[M]
        
        # --> Check escape condition.
        #     Escaped points are no longer iterated.
        M[np.abs(z) > 2] = False
        
    return M
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%timeit
mandelbrot(c, maxiter=1000)
```

The true vectorized implementation is 6 times faster than the one obtained from `np.vectorize`.
Had we considered the test for the main cardioid, it might have been even faster even though we would have had to play a bit with boolean logic on arrays.

## JIT implementation with `numba`

Computing the Mandelbrot set essentially invovles nested `for` loops.
Yet, `for` loops are terribly inefficient in pure Python.
In these cases, Python's scientific computing ecosystem has a few extremely useful packages.
One of them is [**Numba**](https://numba.pydata.org/), an open source *just-in-time* compiler that can translate a subset of Python or NumPy code into fast machine code.
From Numba's webiste

> Numba translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) compiler library. Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or Fortran.

What Numba does basically is to take your na√Øve Python implementation and generates on-the-fly specialized machine code for different array data types and layouts to optimize performance.

```{admonition} Be careful though...
:class: danger
At first, Numba may seem kind of magic and you may be tempted to use it on all your different pieces of code.
It may not however bring the speed-up you expected it would!
For more details about when to use or not Numba JIT capabilities, please read [Numba's documentation](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/5minguide.html).
```

Despite what we've just said, our function `mandelbrot` is luckily an excellent candidate to illustrate the massive speed-up Numba can bring.
After having imported `numba`, using its JIT capabilities is as simple as adding the decorator `@numba.jit()` to your function.
To create a **ufunc**, you can use the `@numba.vectorize` decorator.
This is illustrated below.

**<center>Algorithm 5: Universal function with `numba.vectorize`</center>**

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numba

@numba.jit(nopython=True)
def in_main_cardioid(c):
    z = 1 - np.sqrt(1-4*c)
    return np.abs(z) <= 1 or np.abs(np.conj(z)) <= 1

@numba.vectorize(nopython=True)
def mandelbrot(c, maxiter):
    # --> Check if point is in main cardioid.
    if in_main_cardioid(c): return True
    
    # --> If not, check if it is nonetheless in the
    #     Mandelbrot set.
    z = 0
    for i in range(maxiter):
        if np.abs(z) > 2:
            return False
        z = z**2 + c

    return True
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%timeit
mandelbrot(c, 1000)
```

One limitation of ufuncs generated with `numba` is that they do not accept optional arguments (although you can hack you way into it).
You have to pass all of the arguments.
In all respect, this is a fairly some price given that our code now runs in less than 50 milliseconds, a whooping 780x speed-up compared to our original implementation!
As you increase the resolution, this speed-up will get even larger.

**<center>Algorithm 5: Universal function with `numba.vectorize`</center>**

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numba

@numba.jit(nopython=True)
def in_main_cardioid(c):
    z = 1 - np.sqrt(1-4*c)
    return np.abs(z) <= 1 or np.abs(np.conj(z)) <= 1

@numba.vectorize(nopython=True)
def mandelbrot(c, maxiter):
    # --> Check if point is in main cardioid.
    if in_main_cardioid(c): return True
    
    # --> If not, check if it is nonetheless in the
    #     Mandelbrot set.
    x, y = c.real, c.imag
    x2, y2 = x*x, y*y
    for i in range(maxiter):
        if (x2 + y2) > 4:
            return False
            
        y = 2*x*y + c.imag
        x = x2 - y2 + c.real
        x2, y2 = x*x, y*y

    return True
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%timeit
mandelbrot(c, 1000)
```

## High-resolution visualization

We are now ready to generate our first high-resolution image of the Mandelbrot set.
We'll once again consider $c \in \left[-2.25, 0.75\right] \times \left[ -1.25i, 1.25i\right]$.
The real axis will now be discretized using 3000 points, while the imaginary one is discretized with 2501 points.
For each point (provided it is not in the main cardioid), the quadratic function will be iterated up to 1000 times to check whether the point is in the Mandelbrot set or not.
The code is shown in the cell below (you can toggle it).
The `matplotlib` code used to generate the image is fairly and won't be discussed.
Note however that we could also have used `PIL` instead, another Python package for images.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

# --> Mesh the complex plane.
cr, ci = np.linspace(-2.25, 0.75, 3000), np.linspace(-1.25, 1.25, 2501)
c = cr[:, None] + 1j*ci[None, :] # Broadcasting trick.

# --> Get points in/out the Mandelbrot set.
M = mandelbrot(c, 1000)

# --> Simple binary visualization.
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8, 8))

ax.imshow(
    M.T, 
    extent=[cr.min(), cr.max(), ci.min(), ci.max()],
    cmap=plt.cm.binary)

ax.set_aspect("equal")
ax.axis(False);
```
